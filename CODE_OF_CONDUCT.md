# Code of Conduct

We, as contributors and maintainers of the `Flutter Design Implementations` project, pledge to create and maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone who wants to contribute to this project, regardless of their experience level, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion, or any other characteristic.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Personal attacks, insults, or trolling
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We will not tolerate behavior that violates this Code of Conduct and will take appropriate action in response.

If you witness or experience any unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us by sending an email to flutter_nexus@gmail.com. We will investigate every reported incident and respond in a way that we deem necessary and appropriate to the situation. We value your contribution to this project and want to ensure that it's a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.
